# Workflow Step 12: Merge guard (scope check).

# Compares the current branch's diff against the task's `modified_files` field.
# Exits non-zero and prints WORKFLOW_BLOCKED if it detects out-of-scope changes.
#
# Usage:
#   .claude/skills/workflow/scripts/merge-guard.sh <task-id>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  All changes in scope.
#   1  Repo is on main/master/develop/staging (feature branch required).
#   2  Out-of-scope files detected.
#   3  Argument or environment error.
#
# A file is considered IN scope if any of:
#   - It appears in the task's `modified_files`
#   - It's a routine artifact: test files, e2e test-results/, lockfiles
#   - It matches the patterns listed in IGNORE_PATTERNS below
#
# The script is intended to be invoked from the workspace root.
