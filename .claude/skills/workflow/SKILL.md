name: workflow
description: The main agent SDLC workflow - end to end. Claims work, runs intake, plans, implements changes, runs review if triggered, then closes out the task. Use when the user asks to coordinate a task.
---

You are the workflow coordinator. Your job is to process exactly one JIRA task from start to finish, fully autonomously, with production-grade quality. NEVER SKIP ANY STEPS IN THE OUTLINED PROCESS BELOW.

## Autonomy override

This workflow runs autonomously. The `manage-backlog-tasks` skill contains general guidance that says to "share the plan with the user and ask for confirmation" before coding — **ignore that guidance while running the workflow**. The only human gates in this workflow are the optional steps 3b, 4b, and 10b, and they only activate when explicitly enabled.

## Task Rule

There must always be an associated JIRA issue with any implementation. If one does not exist yet, create one in JIRA with just the details that you already have (use `mcp__plugin_atlassian_atlassian__createJiraIssue`).

## Variable bindings (used throughout)

After Steps 1–2b, you must hold these bindings for the rest of the workflow. If any becomes unset, re-derive it before continuing.

- `<id>` — the task ID claimed in Step 1 (e.g., `task-3`)
- `<title>` — the task title from Step 1
- `<branch>` — the feature branch name captured from `INTAKE_COMPLETE` in Step 2
- `<worktree>` — the absolute worktree path captured from `WORKTREE_READY` in Step 2b

## Working root

**From Step 3 onward, all skills execute with `<worktree>` as their working root.** The worktree is a complete checkout of the feature branch — `frontend/`, `backend/`, `e2e/`, `.claude/`, and all scripts are present there. Script references (e.g., `bash .claude/skills/…`) all resolve correctly from within the worktree.

## Commit discipline

**Do not commit between steps.** Let changes accumulate in the worktree's working tree across all intermediate steps. Step 13 (closeout) is the only place a commit is created — it produces a single conventional commit to the feature branch, then pushes.

Exception: exit-path steps (those that stop the workflow early) commit before stopping so work is not lost.

## Loop & retry caps

- AC verification (Step 6): max 2 retries before emitting `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: AC not met after 2 retries — <ids>` and stopping.
- Unit tests (Step 7): max 2 retries before emitting `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: unit tests failing after 2 retries` and stopping.
- E2E tests (Step 8): max 2 retries before emitting `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: e2e tests failing after 2 retries` and stopping.
- Code review (Step 10): max 1 review→fix→re-review iteration. If a second pass still emits `CODE_REVIEW_BLOCKED`, use the `commit` skill (exit path) and emit `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: code review unresolved after 1 fix iteration`.
- Hostile plan review (Step 4a): max 2 retries before emitting `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: plan failed after 2 retries — <ids>` and stopping.

## Step 1: Check for work

Use the `check-for-work` skill.

Capture `<id>` and `<title>` from the emitted `<id> — <title>`. If `NO_WORK_AVAILABLE` or `CHECK_BLOCKED`, propagate as `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: <reason>` and stop.

## Step 2: Run intake

Use the `intake` skill.

Capture `<branch>` from the emitted `INTAKE_COMPLETE: <branch>`.

## Step 2b: Set up worktree

Use the `setup-worktree` skill.

Capture `<worktree>` from the emitted `WORKTREE_READY: <worktree>`. All subsequent steps run from `<worktree>` as the working root.

## Step 3: Assess task definition

Use the `assess-task` skill.

If `TASK_REFINEMENT_NEEDED`, use the `commit` skill (exit path), then emit `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: <propagated reason>` and stop.

## Step 3b (optional): Human intake approval

**Skip by default.** Only invoke if the user explicitly requested an intake approval gate.

Use the `intake-gate` skill. It commits pending changes and emits `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED` — propagate and stop.

## Step 4: Plan the task

Use the `plan-task` skill.

## Step 4a: AI Hostile Plan Review

Use the `hostile-plan-review` skill.

If `HOSTILE_REVIEW_BLOCKED`, return to Step 4 and revise the plan to address the blocking issues, then re-run this step. Max 2 retries before emitting `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED` and stop.

## Step 4b (optional): Human planning approval

**Skip by default.** Only invoke if the user explicitly requested a planning approval gate.

Use the `plan-gate` skill. It presents the plan to the human interactively:
- `PLAN_GATE_APPROVED` — continue to Step 5.
- Changes requested — the gate reruns `plan-task` once and asks again.
- `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED` (not approved after the retry) — propagate and stop.

## Step 5: Implement Changes

Use the `implement` skill.

## Step 6: Verify AC

Use the `verify-ac` skill.

If `AC_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, return to Step 5 with the failure details. Apply the AC retry cap.

## Step 7: Create/Update Unit Tests and Run All Unit Tests

Use the `unit-tests` skill.

If `UNIT_TESTS_BLOCKED`, return to Step 5 with the failure details. Apply the unit test retry cap.

## Step 8: Run e2e tests

Use the `e2e-tests` skill.

If `E2E_TESTS_BLOCKED`, return to Step 5 with the failure details. Apply the e2e retry cap. `E2E_TESTS_SKIPPED` is not a blocker — continue.

## Step 9: Write implementation notes to the task

Use the `implementation-notes` skill.

## Step 10: Code Review

Use the `code-review` skill.

If `CODE_REVIEW_BLOCKED` (critical/major issues found):
1. Return to Step 5 and address only the issues called out by the review.
2. Re-run Steps 6, 7, 8, 9, and this Step 10.

Apply the code review retry cap.

## Step 10b (optional): Human code review

**Skip by default.** Only invoke if the user explicitly requested a human code review gate.

Use the `code-review-gate` skill. It commits pending changes and emits `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED` — propagate and stop.

## Step 11: Audit Followed All Steps

Use the `audit-followed-workflow-steps` skill.

If `AUDIT_FAILED`, go back and complete the missing steps before continuing.

## Step 11b: Self Improvement Recommendation

Use the `self-improvement` skill.

If `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, propagate and stop — a human must approve the recommendation before closeout.

## Step 12: Merge Guard

Use the `merge-guard` skill.

If `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED`, propagate and stop.

## Step 13: Closeout

Use the `closeout` skill. As part of closeout (after the branch is pushed), it invokes the `open-pr` skill to open a GitHub pull request for `<branch>` and records the PR URL in the Final Summary comment on the JIRA issue.

If `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED`, propagate and stop.

## Rules

- Process exactly one task per invocation
- All task reads and writes go through JIRA MCP tools via the `manage-backlog-tasks` skill — never bypass with direct API calls or file edits
- Single session only: do not run two workflow sessions simultaneously
- If stuck and cannot proceed, output `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: <reason>` so the loop exits cleanly
- Propagate any `*_BLOCKED` output from sub-skills as `WORKFLOW_BLOCKED: <propagated reason>`
- NEVER SKIP ANY STEPS IN THE OUTLINED PROCESS ABOVE.
